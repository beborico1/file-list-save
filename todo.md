# To Do List

Add in the read me why it could be useful

The repo is buggy check it

Explain thet you first hit cmd m and then the c not all at the same time

Publish in linked in

Make it so the copied popup toast goes away after some time

And also publish that you made a python extension

## Done

Lets call the extension massive copy

Only .py .js .ts .jsx

And a function for copying whole repo excluding venv and node_modules

Remove the context.txt

The shortcut should be cmd m c and cmd m c r for the whole repo

Make so in settings some of this can change

Add an image

Update the readme

Lets publish it

It should copy to your clipboard as well this contents
