# To Do List

Publish in Linked In

And also publish that you made a python extension

## Done

Oh the copy repo function should also ignore the folders and the only include the '.py', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx', '.html', '.css', '.json', '.primsa'

Make it so the copied popup toast goes away after some time

Add in the read me why it could be useful

Also Explain thet you first hit cmd m and then the c not all at the same time

Update everything that we now have '.py', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx', '.html', '.css', '.json', '.prisma'

Remove the total files open

Lets call the extension massive copy

Only .py .js .ts .jsx

And a function for copying whole repo excluding venv and node_modules

Remove the context.txt

The shortcut should be cmd m c and cmd m c r for the whole repo

Make so in settings some of this can change

Add an image

Update the readme

Lets publish it

It should copy to your clipboard as well this contents
